mean-height- canopy is my attempt to visualise ATL08 data. Now I have figured it out, hopefully I can change it easily to record other measurements.

MODIS13 is my attempt to visualise the MODIS data (vegetation indices). I assume it is similar to the burn data set which I can open on qgis. This still needs a lot of work, as I am struggling to open the files.

I also haven't put my data into this repository yet, so editing the notebooks remotely will be hard until I manage to do so.
